birdplaydar
-----------

goals:

(1) create utilities that make it easy to call the playdar
    API from a Songbird extension

(2) create a search add-on that facilitates playdar
    search in Songbird

-----------

Birdplaydar exposes the Playdar music content resolver service to Songbird
add-ons via the sbIPlaydarService XPCOM service. The birdplaydar search page lets
you search for tracks using all of your Playdar resolvers. It doesn't matter
where the track actually is; if Playdar can find it, you can listen.
